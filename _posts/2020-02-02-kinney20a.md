title: Causal Feature Learning for Utility-Maximizing Agents
abstract: "Discovering high-level causal relations from low-level \r data is an important
  and challenging problem that comes up frequently in \r the natural and social sciences.
  In a series of papers, Chalupka et al. \r (2015, 2016a, 2016b, 2017) develop a procedure
  for \\textit{causal \r feature learning} (CFL) in an effort to automate this task.
  We argue \r that CFL does not recommend coarsening in cases where pragmatic \r considerations
  rule in favor of it, and recommends coarsening in cases \r where pragmatic considerations
  rule against it. We propose a new \r technique, \\textit{pragmatic causal feature
  learning} (PCFL), which \r extends the original CFL algorithm in useful and intuitive
  ways. We show \r that PCFL has the same attractive measure-theoretic properties
  as the \r original CFL algorithm. We compare the performance of both methods \r
  through theoretical analysis and experiments."
