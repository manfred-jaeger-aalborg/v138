title: "Correlated Equilibria for Approximate Variational\r Inference in MRFs"
abstract: "Almost all of the work in graphical models for game\r theory has mirrored
  previous work in probabilistic graphical models.\r Our work considers the opposite
  direction: Taking advantage of\r advances in equilibrium computation for probabilistic
  inference. In\r particular, we present formulations of inference problems in Markov\r
  random fields (MRFs) as computation of equilibria in a certain class\r of game-theoretic
  graphical models. While some previous work explores\r this direction, we still lack
  a more precise connection between\r variational probabilistic inference in MRFs
  and correlated equilibria.\r This paper sharpens the connection, which helps us
  exploit relatively\r more recent theoretical and empirical results from the literature
  on\r algorithmic and computational game theory on the tractable,\r polynomial-time
  computation of exact or approximate correlated\r equilibria in graphical games with
  arbitrary, loopy graph structure.\r Our work discusses how to design new algorithms
  with equally tractable\r guarantees for the computation of approximate variational
  inference in\r MRFs. In addition, inspired by a previously stated game-theoretic
  view\r of tree-reweighted message-passing techniques for belief inference as\r a
  zero-sum game, we propose a different, general-sum potential game to\r design approximate
  fictitious-play techniques. Empirical evaluations\r on synthetic experiments and
  on an application to soft de-noising on\r real-world image datasets illustrate the
  performance of our proposed\r approach and shed some light on the conditions under
  which the\r resulting belief inference algorithms may be most effective relative\r
  to standard state-of-the-art methods."
