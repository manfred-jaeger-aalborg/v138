title: Investigating Matureness of Probabilistic Graphical Models for Dry-Bulk Shipping
abstract: Dry-bulk shipping is crucial for a functioning global trade economy. Thus,
  additional research is highly relevant to further improve bulk shipping operations.
  Dry-bulk shipping involves many entities interacting with each other in an uncertain
  environment that changes over time. To assist dry-bulk vessel operators in how to
  position their vessels, efficient query answering and decision support is necessary.
  Therefore, we investigate existing modelling formalism and inference algorithms
  regarding which aspects of dry-bulk shipping are already realisable. Although not
  all challenges are already well-understood, we show that a lifted dynamic approach
  tackles most of the challenges involved in handling dry-bulk shipping.
