title: 'CREMA: A Java Library for Credal Network Inference'
abstract: We present CREMA (Credal Models Algorithms), a Java library for inference
  in credal networks. These models are analogous to Bayesian networks, but their local
  parameters are only constrained to vary in, so-called credal, sets. Inference in
  credal networks is intended as the computation of the bounds of a query with respect
  to those local variations. For credal networks the task is harder than in Bayesian
  networks, being NP^PP-hard in general models. Yet, scalable approximate algorithms
  have been shown to provide good accuracies on large or dense models, while exact
  techniques can be designed to process small or sparse models. CREMA embeds these
  algorithms and also offers an API to build and query credal networks together with
  a specification format. This makes CREMA, whose features are discussed and described
  by a simple example, the most advanced tool for credal network modelling and inference
  developed so far.
