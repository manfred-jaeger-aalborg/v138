title: Learning Optimal Cyclic Causal Graphs from Interventional Data
abstract: "We consider causal discovery in a very general setting\r involving non-linearities,
  cycles and several experimental datasets in\r which only a subset of variables are
  recorded. Recent approaches\r combining constraint-based causal discovery, weighted
  independence\r constraints and exact optimization have shown improved accuracy.\r
  However, they have mainly focused on the d-separation criterion, which\r is theoretically
  correct only under strong assumptions such as\r linearity or acyclicity. The more
  recently introduced sigma-separation\r criterion for statistical independence enables
  constraint-based causal\r discovery for non-linear relations over cyclic structures.
  In this work we\r make several contributions in this setting. (i) We generalize
  bcause, a\r recent exact branch-and-bound causal discovery approach, to this\r setting,
  integrating support for the sigma-separation criterion and\r several interventional
  datasets. (ii) We empirically analyze different\r schemes for weighting independence
  constraints in terms of accuracy\r and runtimes of bcause. (iii) We provide improvements
  to a previous\r declarative answer set programming (ASP) based approach for causal\r
  discovery employing the sigma-separation criterion, and empirically\r evaluate bcause
  and the refined ASP-approach."
