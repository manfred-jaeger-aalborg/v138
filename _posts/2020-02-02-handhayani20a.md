title: Kernel-based Approach for Learning Causal Graphs from Mixed Data
abstract: "A causal graph can be generated from a dataset using a particular\r causal
  algorithm, for instance, the PC algorithm or Fast Causal\r Inference (FCI). This
  paper provides two contributions in learning\r causal graphs: an easy way to handle
  mixed data so that it can\r be used to learn causal graphs using the PC algorithm/FCI
  and a\r method to evaluate the learned graph structure when the true graph\r is
  unknown. This research proposes using kernel functions and Kernel\r Alignment to
  handle mixed data. The two main steps of this approach are\r computing a kernel
  matrix for each variable and calculating a\r pseudo-correlation matrix using Kernel
  Alignment. The Kernel\r Alignment matrix is used as a substitute for the correlation
  matrix\r that is the main component used in computing a partial correlation\r for
  the conditional independence test for Gaussian data in the PC\r Algorithm and FCI.
  The advantage of this idea is that is possible to\r handle more data types when
  there is a suitable kernel function to\r compute a kernel matrix for an observed
  variable. The proposed\r method is successfully applied to learn a causal graph
  from mixed\r data containing categorical, binary, ordinal, and continuous\r variables.
  We also introduce the Modal Value of Edges Existence\r (MVEE) method, a new method
  to evaluate the structure of learned\r graphs represented by Partial Ancestral Graph
  (PAG) when the true\r graph is unknown. MVEE produces an agreement graph as a proxy
  to the\r true graph to evaluate the structure of the learned graph. MVEE is\r successfully
  used to choose the best-learned graph when the true\r graph is unknown. "
