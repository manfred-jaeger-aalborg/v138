title: Identifiability and Consistency of Bayesian Network Structure Learning from
  Incomplete Data
abstract: "Bayesian network (BN) structure learning from complete data has been          \r
  extensively studied in the literature. However, fewer theoretical results are \r
  available for incomplete data, and most are based on the use of the           \r
  Expectation-Maximisation (EM) algorithm. Balov (2013) proposed an alternative\r
  approach called Node-Average Likelihood (NAL) that is competitive with EM but \r
  computationally more efficient; and proved its consistency and model          \r
  identifiability for discrete BNs.                                             \r
  In this paper, we give general sufficient conditions for the consistency of   \r
  NAL; and we prove consistency and identifiability for conditional Gaussian    \r
  BNs, which include discrete and Gaussian BNs as special cases. Hence NAL      \r
  has a wider applicability than originally stated in Balov (2013)."
