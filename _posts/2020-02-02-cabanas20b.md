title: Probabilistic Graphical Models with Neural Networks in InferPy
abstract: InferPy is an open-source Python package for variational inference in probabilistic
  models containing neural networks. Other similar libraries are often difficult for
  non-expert users. InferPy provides a much more compact and simple way to code such
  models, at the expense of slightly reducing expressibility and flexibility. The
  main objective of this package is to permit its use without having a strong theoretical
  background or thorough knowledge of the deep learning frameworks.
