title: Dual Formulation of the Chordal Graph Conjecture
abstract: The idea of an integer linear programming approach to structural learning
  of decomposable graphical models led to the study of the so-called chordal graph
  polytope. An open mathematical question is what is the minimal set of linear inequalities
  defining this polytope. Some time ago we came up with a specific conjecture that
  the polytope is defined by so-called clutter inequalities. In this theoretical paper
  we give a dual formulation of the conjecture. Specifically, we introduce a certain
  dual polyhedron defined by trivial equality constraints, simple monotonicity inequalities
  and certain inequalities assigned to incomplete chordal graphs. The main result
  is that the list of (all) vertices of this bounded polyhedron gives rise to the
  list of (all) facet-defining inequalities of the chordal graph polytope. The original
  conjecture is then equivalent to a statement that all vertices of the dual polyhedron
  are zero-one vectors. This dual formulation of the conjecture offers a more intuitive
  view on the problem and allows us to disprove the conjecture.
