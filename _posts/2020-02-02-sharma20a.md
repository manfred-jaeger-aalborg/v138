title: A Score-and-Search Approach to Learning Bayesian Networks with Noisy-OR Relations
abstract: A Bayesian network is a probabilistic graphical model that consists of a
  directed acyclic graph (DAG), where each node is a random variable and attached
  to each node is a conditional probability distribution (CPD). A Bayesian network
  can be learned from data using the well-known score-and-search approach, and within
  this approach a key consideration is how to simultaneously learn the global structure
  in the form of the underlying DAG and the local structure in the CPDs. Several useful
  forms of local structure have been identified in the literature but thus far the
  score-and-search approach has only been extended to handle local structure in form
  of context-specific independence. In this paper, we show how to extend the score-and-search
  approach to the important and widely useful case of noisy-OR relations. We provide
  an effective gradient descent algorithm to score a candidate noisy-OR using the
  widely used BIC score and we provide pruning rules that allow the search to successfully
  scale to medium sized networks. Our empirical results provide evidence for the success
  of our approach to learning Bayesian networks that incorporate noisy-OR relations.
