title: "PGM_PyLib: A Toolkit for Probabilistic Graphical Models \r in Python"
abstract: "PGM{_}PyLib is a toolkit that contains a wide range of \r Probabilistic
  Graphical Models algorithms implemented in Python, and \r serves as a companion
  of the book Probabilistic Graphical Models: \r Principles and Applications. Currently,
  the algorithms implemented \r include: Bayesian classifiers, hidden Markov models,
  Markov random \r fields, and Bayesian networks; as well as some general functions.
  The \r toolkit is open source, can be downloaded from: \r https://github.com/jona2510/PGM{_}PyLib
