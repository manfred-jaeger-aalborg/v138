title: Hierarchical Dependency Constrained Averaged One-Dependence Estimators Classifiers
  for Hierarchical Feature Spaces
abstract: The Averaged One-Dependence Estimators classifier is a type of probabilistic
  graphical model that constructs an ensemble of one-dependency networks, using each
  feature in turn as a parent node for all other features, in order to estimate the
  distribution of the data. In this work, we propose two new types of Hierarchical
  dependency constrained Averaged One-Dependence Estimators (Hie-AODE) algorithms,
  which consider the pre-defined parent-child relationship between features during
  the construction of individual one-dependence estimators, when coping with hierarchically
  structured features. Experiments with 28 real-world bioinformatics datasets showed
  that the proposed Hie-AODE methods obtained better predictive performance than the
  conventional AODE classifier, and enhanced the robustness against imbalanced class
  distributions.
