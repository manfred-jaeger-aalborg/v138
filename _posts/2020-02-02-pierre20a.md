title: Gaussian Sum-Product Networks Learning in the Presence of Interval Censored
  Data
abstract: "Sum-Product Networks (SPNs) can be seen as deep mixture models that have
  demonstrated efficient and tractable inference properties. In this context, graph
  and parameters learning have been deeply studied but the standard approaches do
  not apply to interval censored data.\r In this paper, we derive an approach for
  learning SPN parameters based on maximum likelihood using Expectation-Maximization
  (EM) in the context of interval censored data. Assuming the graph structure known,
  our algorithm makes possible to learn Gaussian leaves parameters of SPNs with right,
  left or interval censored data. We show that our EM algorithm for incomplete data
  outperforms other strategies such as the midpoint for censored intervals or dropping
  incomplete values."
