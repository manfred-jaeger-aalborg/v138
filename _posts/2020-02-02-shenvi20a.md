title: Constructing a Chain Event Graph from a Staged Tree
abstract: 'Chain Event Graphs (CEGs) are a recent family of probabilistic graphical
  models - a generalisation of Bayesian Networks - providing an explicit representation
  of structural zeros, structural missing values and context-specific conditional
  independences within their graph topology. A CEG is constructed from an event tree
  through a sequence of transformations beginning with the colouring of the vertices
  of the event tree to identify one-step transition symmetries. This coloured event
  tree, also known as a staged tree, is the output of the learning algorithms used
  for this family. Surprisingly, no general algorithm has yet been devised that automatically
  transforms any staged tree into a CEG representation. In this paper we provide a
  simple iterative backward algorithm for this transformation. Additionally, we show
  that no information is lost from transforming a staged tree into a CEG. Finally,
  we demonstrate that with an optimal stopping criterion, our algorithm is more efficient
  than the generalisation of a special case presented in Silander and Leong (2013).
  We also provide Python code using this algorithm to obtain a CEG from any staged
  tree along with the functionality to add edges with sampling zeros. '
