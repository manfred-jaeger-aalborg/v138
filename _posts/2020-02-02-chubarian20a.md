title: " Approximating bounded tree-width Bayesian network classifiers with OBDD"
abstract: It is shown that Bayesian network classifiers of tree-width $k$ have an
  OBDD approximation computable in polynomial time in the parameters, for every fixed
  $k$. This is shown by approximating a polynomial threshold function representing
  the classifier. The approximation error can be measured with respect to any distribution
  which can be approximated by a mixture of bounded width distributions. This includes
  the input distribution of the classifier.
