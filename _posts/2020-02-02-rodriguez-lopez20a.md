title: Knowledge Transfer for Learning Markov Equivalence Classes
abstract: There are domains, such as in biology, medicine, and neuroscience, where
  the causal relations vary across members of a population, and where it may be difficult
  to collect data for some specific members. For these domains, it is convenient to
  develop algorithms that, from small sample sizes,  can discover the specific causal
  relations of a subject.  Learning these subject-specific models with the existing
  causal discovery algorithms could be difficult.  Most of them were designed to find
  the common causal relations of a population in the large sample limit. Although
  transfer learning techniques have shown to be useful for improving predictive associative
  models learned with limited data sets, their application in the field of causal
  discovery has not been sufficiently explored.  In this paper, we propose a knowledge
  transfer algorithm for discovering Markov equivalence classes for subject-specific
  causal models. We explore transferring weighted instances of auxiliary data sets,
  according to their relevance, for improving models learned with limited sample sizes.
  Experimental results on data sets generated from simulated and benchmark causal
  Bayesian networks show that our method outperforms in adjacency and arrowhead recovery
  the base and a similar knowledge transfer discovery methods.
