title: On a possibility of gradual model-learning
abstract: 'In this paper, the term of gradual learning describes the process, in which
  an $n$-dimensional model is constructed in $n$ steps; each step increases the dimensionality
  of the constructed model by one. The approach is explained using the apparatus of
  compositional models since its algebraic properties seem to serve the purpose best.
  The paper shows also the equivalence of compositional models and Bayesian networks,
  and thus the paper gives a hint that the approach applies to the graphical model
  as well. '
