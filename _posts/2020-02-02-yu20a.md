title: Hawkesian Graphical Event Models
abstract: 'Graphical event models (GEMs) provide a framework for graphical representation
  of multivariate point processes. We propose a class of GEMs named Hawkesian graphical
  event models (HGEMs) for representing temporal dependencies among different types
  of events from either a single event stream or multiple independent streams. In
  our proposed model, the intensity function for an event label is a linear combination
  of time-shifted kernels where time shifts correspond to prior occurrences of causal
  event labels in the history, as in a Hawkes process. The number of parameters in
  our model scales linearly in the number of edges in the graphical model, enabling
  efficient estimation and inference. This is in contrast to many existing GEMs where
  the number of parameters scales exponentially in the edges. We use two types of
  kernels: exponential and Gaussian kernels, and propose a two-step algorithm that
  combines the strengths of both kernels and learns the structure for the underlying
  graphical model. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate the
  efficacy of the proposed HGEM, and exhibit expressive power of the two-step learning
  algorithm in characterizing self-exciting event patterns and reflecting intrinsic
  Granger-causal relationships.'
