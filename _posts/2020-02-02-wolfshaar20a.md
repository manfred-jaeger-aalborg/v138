title: Deep Generalized Convolutional Sum-Product Networks
abstract: Sum-Product Networks (SPNs) are hierarchical, graphical models that combine
  benefits of deep learning and probabilistic modeling. SPNs offer unique advantages
  to applications demanding exact probabilistic inference over high-dimensional, noisy
  inputs. Yet, compared to convolutional neural nets, they struggle with capturing
  complex spatial relationships in image data. To alleviate this issue, we introduce
  Deep Generalized Convolutional Sum-Product Networks (DGC-SPNs), which encode spatial
  features in a way similar to CNNs, while preserving the validity of the probabilistic
  SPN model. As opposed to existing SPN-based image representations, DGC-SPNs allow
  for overlapping convolution patches through a novel parameterization of dilations
  and strides, resulting in significantly improved feature coverage and feature resolution.
  DGC-SPNs substantially outperform other SPN architectures across several visual
  datasets and for both generative and discriminative tasks, including image inpainting
  and classification. These contributions are reinforced by the first simple, scalable,
  and GPU-optimized implementation of SPNs, integrated with the widely used Keras/TensorFlow
  framework. The resulting model is fully probabilistic and versatile, yet efficient
  and straightforward to apply in practical applications in place of traditional deep
  nets.
