title: 'CREDICI: A Java Library for Causal Inference by Credal Networks'
abstract: We present CREDICI, a Java open-source tool for causal inference based on
  credal networks. Credal networks are an extension of Bayesian networks where local
  probability mass functions are only constrained to belong to given, so-called credal,
  sets. CREDICI is based on the recent work of Zaffalon et al. (2020), where an equivalence
  between Pearl’s structural causal models and credal networks has been derived. This
  allows to reduce a counterfactual query in a causal model to a standard query in
  a credal network, even in the case of unidentifiable causal effects. The necessary
  transformations and data structures are implemented in CREDICI, while inferences
  are eventually computed by CREMA (Huber et al., 2020), a twin library for general
  credal network inference. Here we discuss the main implementation challenges and
  possible outlooks.
