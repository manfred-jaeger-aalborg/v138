title: Poset Representations for Sets of Elementary Triplets
abstract: Semi-graphoid independence relations, composed of independence triplets,
  are typically exponentially large in the number of variables involved. For compact
  representation of such a relation, just a subset of its triplets, called a basis,
  are listed explicitly, while its other triplets remain implicit through a set of
  derivation rules.  Two types of basis were defined for this purpose, which are the
  dominant-triplet basis and the elementary-triplet basis, of which the latter is
  commonly assumed to be significantly larger in size in general. In this paper we
  introduce the elementary po-triplet as a compact representation of multiple elementary
  triplets, by using separating posets.  By exploiting this new representation, the
  size of an elementary-triplet basis can be reduced considerably.  For computing
  the elementary closure of a starting set of po-triplets, we present an elegant algorithm
  that operates on the least and largest elements of the separating posets involved.
