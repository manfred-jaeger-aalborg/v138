title: " Discriminative Non-Parametric Learning of Arithmetic Circuits"
abstract: " Arithmetic Circuits (AC) and Sum-Product Networks (SPN) have recently
  gained significant interest by virtue of being tractable deep probabilistic models.
  We propose the first gradient-boosted method for structure learning of discriminative
  ACs (DACs), called DACBOOST. In discrete domains ACs are essentially equivalent
  to mixtures of trees, thus DACBOOST decomposes a large AC into smaller tree-structured
  ACs and learns them in sequential, additive manner. The resulting non-parametric
  manner of learning DACs results in a model with very few tuning parameters making
  our learned model significantly more efficient. We demonstrate on standard data
  sets and real data sets, efficiency of DACBOOST compared to state-of-the-art DAC
  learners without sacrificing effectiveness."
