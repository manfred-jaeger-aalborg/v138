title: 'BayesSuites: An Open Web Framework for Visualization of Massive Bayesian Networks'
abstract: BayesSuites is the first web framework for learning, visualizing, and interpreting
  Bayesian networks that can scale to tens of thousands of nodes while providing fast
  and friendly user experience. BayesSuites solves the problems of scalability, extensibility
  and interpretability that massive networks bring by separating backend calculations
  from the frontend interface and using specialized learning algorithms for massive
  networks. We demonstrate the tool by learning and visualizing a genome-wide gene
  regulatory network from human brain data with 20,708 nodes.
