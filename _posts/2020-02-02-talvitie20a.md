title: Learning Bayesian Networks with Cops and Robbers
abstract: 'Constraint-based methods for learning structures of Bayesian networks are
  based on testing conditional independencies between variables and constructing a
  structure that expresses the same conditional independencies as indicated by the
  tests. We present a constraint-based algorithm that learns the structure of a Bayesian
  network by simulating a cops-and-a-robber game. The algorithm is designed for learning
  structures of low treewidth distributions and in such case it conducts conditional
  independence tests only with small conditioning sets. '
