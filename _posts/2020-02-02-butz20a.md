title: Sum-Product Network Decompilation
abstract: There exists a dichotomy between classical probabilistic graphical models,
  such as Bayesian networks (BNs), and modern tractable models, such as sum-product
  networks (SPNs). The former generally have intractable inference, but provide a
  high level of interpretability, while the latter admit a wide range of tractable
  inference routi        nes, but are typically harder to interpret. Due to this dichotomy,
  tools to convert between BNs and SPNs are desirable. While one direction – compiling
  BNs into SPNs – is well discussed in Darwiche’s seminal work on arithmetic circuit
  compilation, the converse direction – decompiling SPNs into BNs – has received surprisingly
  little attention. In this paper, we fill this gap by proposing SPN2BN, an algorithm
  that decompiles an SPN into a BN. SPN2BN has several salient features when compared
  to the only other two works decompiling SPNs. Most significantly, the BNs returned
  by SPN2BN are minimal independence-maps that are more parsimonious with respect
  to the introduction of latent variables. Secondly, the output BN produced by SPN2BN
  can be precisely characterized with respect to a compiled BN. More specifically,
  a certain set of directed edges will be added to the input BN, giving what we will
  call the moral-closure. Lastly, it is established that our compilation-decompilation
  process is idempotent. This has practical significance as it limits the size of
  the decompiled SPN.
