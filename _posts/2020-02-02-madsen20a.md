title: Prediction of High Risk of Deviations in Home Care Deliveries
abstract: "\r This paper presents a real-world application of Bayesian networks to\r
  support existing home care quality supervision.  In Denmark home\r care is delivered
  by municipalities, where the individual citizen is\r free to select the service
  provider, private or public. The aim of\r our work is to support the home care control
  process by identifying\r significant deviations automatically, pointing to reasons
  for a\r significant deviation and identifying future home care deliveries\r where
  there is a high probability of deviation between granted and\r delivered care to
  the individual citizen. Home care is granted as\r packages of time measured in minutes
  and we define a too high\r delivery rate as larger than $150%$. In the municipality
  under\r study in this work (municipality of Hj{ø}rring), the supervision of\r home
  care delivery is a manual and time consuming process prone to\r human error.  This
  paper presents the results of efforts to automate\r parts of the supervision using
  Bayesian network modelling and data\r analysis. The results of the pilot study shows
  significant potential\r in applying Bayesian network modelling and data analysis
  to this\r challenge for the benefit of the municipality, the employees and the\r
  citizens.\r "
