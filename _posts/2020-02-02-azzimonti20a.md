title: Structure Learning from Related Data Sets with a Hierarchical Bayesian Score
abstract: Score functions for learning the structure of Bayesian networks in the literature
  assume that data are a homogeneous set of observations; whereas it is often the
  case that they comprise different related, but not homogeneous, data sets collected
  in different ways. In this paper we propose a new Bayesian Dirichlet score, which
  we call Bayesian Hierarchical Dirichlet (BHD). The proposed score is based on a
  hierarchical model that pools information across data sets to learn a single encompassing
  network structure, while taking into account the differences in their probabilistic
  structures. We derive a closed-form expression for BHD using a variational approximation
  of the marginal likelihood and we study its performance using simulated data. We
  find that, when data comprise multiple related data sets, BHD outperforms the Bayesian
  Dirichlet equivalent uniform (BDeu) score in terms of reconstruction accuracy as
  measured by the Structural Hamming distance, and that it is as accurate as BDeu
  when data are homogeneous. Moreover, the estimated networks are sparser and therefore
  more interpretable than those obtained with BDeu, thanks to a lower number of false
  positive arcs.
