title: " Bayesian network structure learning with causal effects in the presence of
  latent variables "
abstract: " Latent variables may lead to spurious relationships that can be misinterpreted
  as causal relationships. In Bayesian Networks (BNs), this challenge is known as
  learning under causal insufficiency. Structure learning algorithms that assume causal
  insufficiency tend to reconstruct the ancestral graph of a BN, where bi-directed
  edges represent confounding and directed edges represent direct or ancestral relationships.
  This paper describes a hybrid structure learning algorithm, called CCHM, which combines
  the constraint-based part of cFCI with hill-climbing score-based learning. The score-based
  process incorporates Pearlâ€™s do-calculus to measure causal effects, which are used
  to orientate edges that would otherwise remain undirected, under the assumption
  the BN is a linear Structure Equation Model where data follow a multivariate Gaussian
  distribution. Experiments based on both randomised and well-known networks show
  that CCHM improves the state-of-the-art in terms of reconstructing the true ancestral
  graph."
