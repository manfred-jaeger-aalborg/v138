title: Scalable Bayesian Network Structure Learning via Maximum Acyclic Subgraph
abstract: Learning the structure of a Bayesian network is an NP-hard problem and exact
  learning algorithms that are guaranteed to find an optimal structure are not feasible
  with large number of variables. Thus, large-scale learning is usually done using
  heuristics that do not provide any quality guarantees. We present a heuristic method
  that scales up to networks with hundreds of variables and provides quality guarantees
  in terms of an upper bound for the score of the optimal network. The proposed method
  consists of two parts. First, we simplify the problem by approximating local scores
  using so-called edge scores. With the edge scores learning an optimal Bayesian network
  structure is equivalent to finding the maximum acyclic subgraph. Second, we solve
  the maximum acyclic subgraph problem fast using integer linear programming. Additionally,
  we choose the approximation in a specific way so that an upper bound for the score
  of an optimal network can be obtained.
