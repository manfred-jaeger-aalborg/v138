title: Two Reformulation Approaches to Maximum-A-Posteriori Inference in Sum-Product
  Networks
abstract: Sum-product networks are expressive efficient probabilistic graphical models
  that allow for tractable marginal inference. Many tasks however require the computation
  of maximum-a-posteriori configurations, an NP-Hard problem for such models. To date
  there have been very few proposals for computing maximum-a-posteriori configurations
  in sum-product networks. This is in sharp difference with other probabilistic frameworks
  such as Bayesian networks and random Markov fields, where the problem is also NP-hard.
  In this work we propose two approaches to reformulate maximum-a-posteriori inference
  as other combinatorial optimization problems with widely available solvers. The
  first approach casts the problem as a similar inference problem in Bayesian networks,
  overcoming some limitations of previous similar translations. In addition to making
  available the toolset of maximum-a-posteriori inference on Bayesian networks to
  sum-product networks, our reformulation also provides further  insight into the
  connections of these two classes of models. The second approach casts the problem
  as a mixed-integer linear program, for which there exists very efficient solvers.
  This allows such inferences to be enriched with integer-linear constraints, increasing
  the expressivity of the models. We compare our reformulation approaches in a large
  collection of problems, and against state-of-the-art approaches. The results show
  that reformulation approaches are competitive.
