title: Bayesian Network Model Averaging Classifiers by Subbagging
abstract: For classification problems, Bayesian networks are often used to infer a
  class variable when given feature variables. Earlier reports have described that
  the classification accuracy of Bayesian network structures achieved by maximizing
  the marginal likelihood (ML) is lower than that achieved by maximizing the conditional
  log likelihood (CLL) of a class variable given the feature variables. However, the
  performance of Bayesian network structures achieved by maximizing ML is not necessarily
  worse than that achieved by maximizing CLL for large data because ML has asymptotic
  consistency. As the sample size becomes small, however, the error of learning structures
  by maximizing the ML becomes rapidly large; it then degrades the classification
  accuracy. As a method to resolve this shortcoming, model averaging, which marginalizes
  the class variable posterior over all structures, has been proposed. However, the
  posterior standard error of the structures in the model averaging becomes large
  as the sample size becomes small; it subsequently degrades the classification accuracy.
  The main idea of this study is to improve the classification accuracy using the
  subbagging to reduce the posterior standard error of the structures in the model
  averaging. Moreover, to guarantee asymptotic consistency, we use the $K$-best method
  with the ML score. The experimentally obtained results demonstrate that our proposed
  method provides more accurate classification for small data than earlier methods
  do.
