title: Constraing-Based Learning for Continous-Time Bayesian Networks
abstract: "Dynamic Bayesian networks have been well explored in the literature as
  discrete-time models; however, their continuous-time extensions have seen comparatively
  little attention.\r In this paper, we propose the first constraint-based algorithm
  for learning the structure of continuous-time Bayesian networks.\r We discuss the
  different statistical tests and the underlying hypotheses used by our proposal to
  establish conditional independence.\r Finally, we validate its performance using
  synthetic data, and discuss its strengths and limitations.\r We find that score-based
  is more accurate in learning networks with binary variables, while our\r constraint-based
  approach is more accurate with variables assuming more than two values. However,\r
  more experiments are needed for confirmation."
