title: Efficient Heuristic Search for M-Modes Inference
abstract: M-Modes is the problem of finding the top M locally optimal solutions of
  a graphical model, called modes. These modes provide geometric characterization
  of the energy landscape of a graphical model and lead to high quality solutions
  in structured prediction. It has been shown that any mode must be a local MAP within
  every subgraph of certain size. The state-of-the-art method is a search algorithm
  that explores subgraphs in a fixed ordering, uses each subgraph as a layer and searches
  for a consistent concatenation of local MAPs. We observe that for the M-Modes problem,
  different search orderings can lead to search spaces with dramatically different
  sizes, resulting in huge differences in performance. We formalize a metric measuring
  the quality of different orderings. We then formulate finding an optimized ordering
  as a shortest path problem, and introduce pruning criteria to speed up the search.
  Our empirical results show that using optimized orderings improves the efficiency
  of M-Modes search by up to orders of magnitude.
