title: A New Perspective on Learning Context-Specific Independence
abstract: Local structure such as context-specific independence (CSI) has received
  much attention in the probabilistic graphical model (PGM) literature, as it facilitates
  the modeling of large complex systems, as well as for reasoning with them. In this
  paper, we provide a new perspective on how to learn CSIs from data. We propose to
  first learn a functional and parameterized representation of a conditional probability
  distribution (CPD), such as a neural network. Next, we quantize this continuous
  function, into an arithmetic circuit representation that facilitates efficient inference.
  In the first step, we can leverage the many powerful tools that have been developed
  in the machine learning literature. In the second step, we exploit more recently-developed
  analytic tools from explainable AI, for the purposes of learning CSIs. Finally,
  we contrast our approach, empirically and conceptually, with more traditional variable-splitting
  approaches, that search for CSIs more explicitly.
