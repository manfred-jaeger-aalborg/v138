title: Solving Multiple Inference by Minimizing Expected Loss
abstract: Multiple Inference is the problem of finding multiple top solutions for
  an inference problem in a graphical model. It has been shown that it is beneficial
  for the top solutions to be diverse. However, existing methods, such as diverse
  M-Best and M-Modes, often rely on a hyper parameter in enforcing diversity. The
  optimal values of such parameters usually depend on the probability landscape of
  the graphical model and thus have to be tuned case by case via cross validation.
  This is not a desirable property. In this paper, we introduce a parameter-free method
  that directly minimizes the expected loss of each solution in finding multiple top
  solutions that have high oracle accuracy, and are automatically diverse. Empirical
  evaluations show that our method often have better performance than other competing
  methods.
