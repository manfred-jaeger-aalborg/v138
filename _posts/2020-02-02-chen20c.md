title: Supervised Learning with Background Knowledge
abstract: 'We consider the task of supervised learning while focusing on the impact
  that background knowledge may have on the accuracy and robustness of learned classifiers.
  We consider three types of background knowledge: causal domain knowledge, functional
  dependencies and logical constraints. Our findings are set in the context of an
  empirical study that compares two classes of classifiers: Arithmetic Circuit (AC)
  classifiers compiled from Bayesian network models with varying degrees of background
  knowledge, and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifiers. We report on the
  accuracy and robustness of such classifiers on two tasks concerned with recognizing
  synthesized shapes in noisy images. We show that classifiers that encode background
  knowledge need much less data to attain certain accuracies and are more robust against
  noise level in the data and also against mismatches between noise patterns in the
  training and testing data.'
