title: "aGrUM/pyAgrum : a toolbox to build models and algorithms \r for Probabilistic
  Graphical Models in Python"
abstract: "This paper presents the aGrUM framework, a LGPL C++ \r library providing
  state-of-the-art implementations of graphical models \r for decision making, including
  Bayesian Networks, Markov Networks \r (Markov random fields), Influence Diagrams,
  Credal Networks, \r Probabilistic Relational Models. The framework also contains
  a wrapper, \r pyAgrum for exploiting aGrUM in Python. This framework is the result
  of \r an ongoing effort to build an efficient and well maintained open source \r
  cross-platform software, running on Linux, MacOS X and Windows, for \r dealing with
  graphical models and for providing essential components to \r build new algorithms
  for graphical models."
