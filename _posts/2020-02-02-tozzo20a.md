title: Missing Values in Multiple Joint Inference of Gaussian Graphical Models
abstract: 'Real-world phenomena are often not fully measured or completely observable,
  raising the so-called missing data problem.   As  a  consequence,  the  need  of  developing  ad-hoc  techniques  that  cope
  with  such  issue  arises  in  many  inference  contexts.   In  this  paper,  we  focus  on  the  inference  of
  Gaussian Graphical Models (GGMs) from multiple input datasets having complex relationships(e.g.
  multi-class or temporal).  We propose a method that generalises state-of-the-art
  approaches to the inference of both multi-class and temporal GGMs while naturally
  dealing with two types of  missing  data:  partial  and  latent.   Synthetic  experiments  show  that  our  performance  is  better
  than state-of-the-art.   In particular,  we compared results with single network
  inference methods that suitably deal with missing data, and multiple joint network
  inference methods coupled with standard pre-processing techniques (e.g. imputing).   When
  dealing with fully observed datasets our method analytically reduces to state-of-the-art
  approaches providing a good alternative as our implementation reaches convergence
  in shorter or comparable time. Finally, we show that properly addressing the missing
  data problem in a multi-class real-world example,  allows us to discover interesting
  varying patterns.'
