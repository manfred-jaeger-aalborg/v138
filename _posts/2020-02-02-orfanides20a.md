title: Learning decomposable models by coarsening
abstract: During the last decade, some exact algorithms have been proposed for learning
  decomposable models by maximizing additively decomposable score functions, such
  as Log-likelihood, BDeu, and BIC. However, up to the date, the proposed exact approaches
  are practical for learning models up to $20$ variables. In this work, we present
  an approximated procedure that can learn decomposable models over hundreds of variables
  with a remarkable trade-off between the quality of the obtained solution and the
  amount of the computational resources required. The proposed learning procedure
  iteratively constructs a sequence of coarser decomposable (chordal) graphs. At each
  step, given a decomposable graph, the algorithm adds the subset of edges due to
  the actual minimal separators that maximizes the score function while maintaining
  the chordality. The proposed procedure has shown competitive results for learning
  decomposable models over hundred of variables using a reasonable amount of computational
  resources. Finally, we empirically show that it can be used to reduce the search
  space of exact procedures, which would allow them to address the learning of high-dimensional
  decomposable models.
