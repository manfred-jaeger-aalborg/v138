title: "Differentiable TAN Structure Learning for Bayesian Network\r Classifiers"
abstract: "Learning the structure of Bayesian networks is a\r difficult combinatorial
  optimization problem. In this paper, we consider\r learning of tree-augmented naive
  Bayes (TAN) structures for Bayesian\r network classifiers with discrete input features.
  Instead of performing\r a combinatorial optimization over the space of possible
  graph\r structures, the proposed method learns a distribution over graph\r structures.
  After training, we select the most probable structure of\r this distribution. This
  allows for a joint training of the Bayesian\r network parameters along with its
  TAN structure using gradient-based\r optimization. The proposed method is agnostic
  to the specific loss and\r only requires that it is differentiable. We perform extensive\r
  experiments using a hybrid generative-discriminative loss based on the\r discriminative
  probabilistic margin. Our method consistently outperforms\r random TAN structures
  and Chow-Liu TAN structures."
