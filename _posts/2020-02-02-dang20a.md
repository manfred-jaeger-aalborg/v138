title: 'Strudel: Learning Structured-Decomposable Probabilistic Circuits'
abstract: " Probabilistic circuits (PCs) represent a probability distribution as a
  computational graph. Enforcing structural properties on these graphs guarantees
  that several inference scenarios become tractable. Among these properties, structured
  decomposability is a particularly appealing one: it enables the efficient and exact
  computations of the probability of complex logical formulas, and can be used to
  reason about the expected output of certain predictive models under missing data.
  This paper proposes Strudel, a simple, fast and accurate learning algorithm for
  structured-decomposable PCs. Compared to prior work for learning structured-decomposable
  PCs, Strudel delivers more accurate single PC models in fewer iterations, and dramatically
  scales learning when building ensembles of PCs. It achieves this scalability by
  exploiting another structural property of PCs, called determinism, and by sharing
  the same computational graph across mixture components. We show these advantages
  on standard density estimation benchmarks and challenging inference scenarios."
