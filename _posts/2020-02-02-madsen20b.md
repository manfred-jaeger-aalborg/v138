title: A Software System for Predicting Patient Flow at the Emergency Department of
  Aalborg University Hospital
abstract: "  \r This paper presents a software system for predicting patient flow
  at\r the emergency department of Aalborg University Hospital. The system\r uses
  Bayesian networks as the underlying technology for the\r predictions.  A Bayesian
  network model has been developed for\r predicting the hourly rate of patients arriving
  at the emergency\r department at Aalborg University Hospital. One advantage of using\r
  Bayesian networks is that domain knowledge and historical data can\r easily be combined
  into an intuitive graphical model.  The aim of\r this paper is to describe the software
  system delivering the\r predictions of the Bayesian network model as a decision-support\r
  system for employee shift scheduling at the emergency department.\r "
