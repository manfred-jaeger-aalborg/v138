title: Building Causal Interaction Models by Recursive Unfolding
abstract: Causal interaction models, such as the well-known noisy-or and leaky noisy-or
  models, have become quite popular as a means to parameterize conditional probability
  tables for Bayesian networks. In this paper we focus on the engineering of subnetworks
  to represent such models and present a novel technique called recursive unfolding
  for this purpose. This technique allows inserting, removing and merging cause variables
  in an interaction model at will, without affecting the underlying represented information.
  We detail the technique, with the recursion invariants involved, and illustrate
  its practical use for Bayesian-network engineering by means of a small example.
