title: 'Conditional Sum-Product Networks: Imposing Structure on Deep Probabilistic
  Architectures'
abstract: "Probabilistic graphical models are a central tool in AI, however, they
  are generally not as expressive\r as deep neural models, and inference is notoriously
  hard and slow. In contrast, deep probabilistic\r models such as sum-product networks
  (SPNs) capture joint distributions in a tractable fashion,\r but still lack the
  expressive power of intractable models based on deep neural networks. Therefore,\r
  we introduce conditional SPNs (CSPNs), conditional density estimators for multivariate
  and\r potentially hybrid domains that allow harnessing the expressive power of neural
  networks while\r still maintaining tractability guarantees. One way to implement
  CSPNs is to use an existing SPN\r structure and condition its parameters on the
  input, e.g., via a deep neural network. Our experimental\r evidence demonstrates
  that CSPNs are competitive with other probabilistic models and yield\r superior
  performance on multilabel image classification compared to mean field and mixture
  density\r networks. Furthermore, they can successfully be employed as building blocks
  for structured\r probabilistic models, such as autoregressive image models."
